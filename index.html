    <p align="left">Hi there! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, fortunately, advised by <a href="https://sunju.org/">Prof. Ju Sun</a>. 
        Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). 
        I am interested in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and AI for healthcare.</p>
