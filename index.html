    <p align="left">Hi there! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota (UMN, twin-city), advised by <a href="https://sunju.org/">Prof. Ju Sun</a>. 
        Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/harbin-institute-technology">Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)</a>. 
        My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare.</p>
